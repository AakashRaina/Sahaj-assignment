> Dashboard for viewing emails


### 💻 Demo

- The following project has been bootstrapped via React-Spawn-CLI. It is my personal project and is available via NPM. [View Here] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spawn-cli).
- Clone the repo and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm start` to start the development server.
- Go to `localhost:5000` to view the app.

### 🏃🏻‍♂️ Implemented Features

- Login functionality and auth protected routes. You can login via username: `aakash` and passwd: `12345`. Login is persisted between sessions thanks to `localStorage`.
- Viewing a list of emails in the inbox rendered via mock data. `Read` and `Unread` emails are highlighted separately. `Unread` email count is highlighed on the header.
- You can move between different mailboxes by choosing them on the sidebar on the left. 
- `Delete` and `DeleteAll` email(s). Click on the checkbox for this.
- Click on the email to mark is as `Read`. `Unread` count is updated appropriately.
- Click on `Compose` to create a new email. __Please ensure you enter simple/basic data as this is not a production grade solution__. Created email will be available under `Sent` items.

### 🏃🏻‍♂️ Features Not Implemented

> Owing to time constraints

- Viewing an email to read it. 
- Solution built is not a responsive one.
- Test coverage.
